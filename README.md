This is a collection of experiments and tools revolving around the linux memory
management subsystem. Used to assist in my work writing [The Linux Memory
Manager](https://linuxmemory.org), a book describing the linux memory management
subsystem.

## Building

Varies - make at root builds some things, but things have rapidly 'evolved' into
something of a tangled mess and some things need manual building and others have
their own separate make files.

I will sort this out at some point...! :)
